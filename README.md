# MySolar App
>In South Africa, the challenges of load shedding have inadvertently paved the way for a surge in the adoption of solar power systems. As a response to this shift, my group has been tasked to develop an android app designed not only to help users monitor and maximize their solar power system's efficiency but also to promote the use of greener energy sources. By reducing reliance on the grid, users can not only ensure uninterrupted power but also contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy consumption pattern.

## General Information
- Our app, SolarOptima, aims to address the broader goal of utilising solar power in a South African context beyond just mitigating the effects of load shedding. The problem it solves is the lack of existing apps that factor in various aspects crucial for maximising solar power usage and minimising reliance on the grid.
- **_What problem does it (intend to) solve?_** - Currently, a lot of people have installed or are installing solar powered systems and inverters in order to avoid using grid power and ensure power during load shedding. However, the current software artefacts for these systems are limited in their ability to allow users to make intelligent decisions such as changing their current appliance scheduling or turning on/off appliances in order to maximise their solar power usage and mitigate grid usage. Hence, current artefacts are limited to the present, and do not provide insight into the effect that future consumption might have on their system.
- **_What is the purpose of your project?_** - The main purpose of our app was to optimize the use of solar power as much as possible. As mentioned above, South Africa has a lot of sun available at its exposure and so we want to make full use of the energy from the sun. As mentioned above, there are not many apps available which would minimize the grid usage and optimize power usage.
**GOAL : OPTIMIZE THE USE OF SOLAR POWER AND REDUCE THE USE OF GRID POWER.**
- **_Why did you undertake it (the solution)?_** - Our team developed a forward-thinking solution aimed at enhancing foresight into the future performance of a user's solar power system. By leveraging predictive analytics, the app empowers users to anticipate the impact of their current appliance usage and schedule adjustments. This innovative approach utilises upcoming weather data, energy consumption patterns, and load shedding schedules, coupled with specific details of the user's solar system. The integration of these elements enables the app to provide a projection of the solar power system's behaviour in the near future.
